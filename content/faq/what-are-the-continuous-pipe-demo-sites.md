ContinuousPipe provides some sample applications for common frameworks:

- [Symfony](https://github.com/continuouspipe/demo-symfony)
- [Laravel](https://github.com/continuouspipe/demo-laravel)
- [Drupal 7](https://github.com/continuouspipe/demo-drupal7)
- [Drupal 8](https://github.com/continuouspipe/demo-drupal8)
- [Magento 1](https://github.com/continuouspipe/demo-magento1)
- [Magento 2](https://github.com/continuouspipe/demo-magento2)

They can be used to get an environment running quickly or as a basis for further adaptation to suit the needs of your own organisation.

The demo sites are built on top of [ContinuousPipe images]({{< relref "faq/what-are-the-continuous-pipe-images.md" >}}) so they take advantage of their security and performance best practices.
