## Using the Init Command

```
cp-remote init [token]
```

The `init` command will initialise a remote environment using a token generated by the [ContinuousPipe console](https://ui.continuouspipe.io/). 

If the initialization process is interrupted it can be restarted using the same token and by default it will continue the process where it left off.
You can use `--reset` to start any partial initializations from the beginning.

```
cp-remote init [token] --reset
```
