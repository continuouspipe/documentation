## Using the Init Command

```
cp-remote init [token]
```

The `init` command will initialise a remote environment using a token generated by the Continuous Pipe UI. 

If the initialization process is interrupted it can be restarted using the same token and by default it will continue the process where it left.
You can use `--reset` to start any partials initializations from the beginning.
