## Introduction

In this tutorial we are going to setup a new Laravel project, run it within Docker using one of ContinuousPipe’s base Dockerfiles, then finally push our project to our GitHub repo where ContinuousPipe will build our project and deploy on Google Container Engine. Once we are happy our project is building successfully we will then use ContinuousPipe to manage our cloud based development environment with the `cp-remote` CLI tool.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started you will need the following - 

- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) account to host your Laravel project
- A [ContinuousPipe](https://continuouspipe.io/) account
- A Kubernetes cluster e.g. [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [GCE](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/)
- A Docker Registry account e.g. [docker.io](https://docker.io) or [quay.io](https://quay.io)


## Setting up Laravel

The easiest way to install Laravel is with the Laravel installer, if you don’t have this you can simply follow the instructions to use composer instead. For simplicity we will use the Laravel installer.

```bash
$ laravel new demo-laravel
```

Since we used the Laravel installer, a `.env` file has been created for us and an application key has been set i.e. 

```bash
APP_KEY=base64:OQ8H9vjocvQh284ojDBrODQ2HkrgWGDvdLCaQniHz0M=
```

During our deployments, Laravel needs this key after the composer install runs due to the post-install composer hook. Unfortunately we will not have a `.env` file set at this point so the easiest way to by pass this would be to set a default `APP_KEY.` Within `config/app.php` change line 106

from - 


```php
'key' => env('APP_KEY'),
```

to - 

```php
'key' => env('APP_KEY', 'base64:OQ8H9vjocvQh284ojDBrODQ2HkrgWGDvdLCaQniHz0M='),
```

We will overwrite the default key during deployments.


Since we are going to configure our application to use redis for our cache and session storage we need to add the package `predis/predis` to our project.

```shell
$ composer require predis/predis
```


## Configuring ContinuousPipe

Before we can push any code to our repository, we need to ensure that the ContinuousPipe console is properly configured. Please refer to the ContinuousPipe Quick Start guide to setup your [project]({{< relref "quick-start/creating-a-project.md" >}}), [cluster]({{< relref "quick-start/configuring-a-cluster.md" >}}), [registry]({{< relref "quick-start/configuring-a-registry.md" >}}) and create your first [flow]({{< relref "quick-start/creating-a-flow.md" >}}).

One last thing we need to do before we can begin using ContinuousPipe is configure which cluster we will use. You are free to configure as many clusters as you wish, in fact, its a good idea to have a separate cluster from production as you would for development and testing. 

For now we have only got one cluster configured in ContinuousPipe. Lets assign that cluster name “main-cluster” to an environment variable which can be used with our build and deployment tasks.

From within the flow, click on configuration in the sidebar, create a new environment variable named `CLUSTER` with a value to match what you set as your cluster name/identifier. I have set my cluster name as `main-cluster`. Finally save the configuration.

![Flow Configuration](/images/guides/laravel/flow-variables-configuration.png)

### Adding Docker configuration

Lets start by configuring our `Dockerfile`. We are going to use one of the [ContinuousPipe images]({{< relref "faq/what-are-the-continuous-pipe-images.md" >}}) as our base. In reality, you would want to create a new base image that would extend this image to give you the ability to add other services, such as your NodeJS dependencies often used for the frontend build tools i.e. webpack

> **Dockerfile**
```dockerfile
FROM quay.io/continuouspipe/php7-nginx:stable

COPY ./tools/docker/usr/ /usr/

USER build

# Add the application
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

USER root

# Install dependencies
ARG APP_ENV=
RUN chown -R build:build /app && \
  if [ -n "$APP_ENV" ]; then \
    bash /app/tools/docker/setup/install.sh; \
  fi

```

You will notice from the second line of our Dockerfile that it will copy `tools/docker/usr/` to `/usr/` This is put in place by the inheritance of the configuration from our base image. Its parent image, [Ubuntu Base](https://github.com/continuouspipe/dockerfiles/tree/master/ubuntu/16.04#default-environment-variables) allows us to inject custom environment variables into our container at build time. This allows us to easily manipulate how the build is configured. For example, we can use these to define our web directory which is used to set the nginx vhost `root` configuration.

### Setting additional Docker required files

Lets create a new file in `tools/docker/usr/local/bin/supervisor_custom_start-laravel` with the following - 

>**tools/docker/usr/local/bin/supervisor_custom_start-laravel**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Bring in the as_code_owner function, to run commands as the user who owns the code.
# Usually the "build" user.
source /usr/local/share/bootstrap/common_functions.sh

bash /app/tools/docker/setup/install.sh

# Create env file if missing
bash /app/tools/docker/setup/setup-dotenv.sh

if [ "$REMOTE_ENV" = "1" ]; then
  as_code_owner "php artisan key:generate"
fi
```

The comments should make it clear what each line does however, there are few additional files included in this script we need to create. First is our `install.sh` script, this will do our initial folder setup, run composer install and then set the correct file and folder permissions across our project.

The second included script is used to create our `.env` file from our environment variables. Even though technically Laravel can read our environment variables directly, the file needs to exist to generate a new key as Laravel will save the generated key to this file.

Lets add these files into `tools/docker/setup` - 

>**tools/docker/setup/install.sh**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -xe

# Source variables such as what user the site will be running as
source /usr/local/share/bootstrap/setup.sh

# Bring in the composer running function
source /usr/local/share/php/common_functions.sh

APP_PATH="/app";

# Create missing directories
/app/tools/docker/setup/setup-directories.sh

# Install the app
cd "${APP_PATH}" || exit 1;

run_composer

chown -R "${CODE_OWNER}:${APP_GROUP}" bootstrap/cache/ storage
chmod -R ug+rw,o-w bootstrap/cache/ storage/
chmod +x storage
```

>**tools/docker/setup/setup-dotenv.sh**
```bash
#!/bin/sh

set -xe

ENV_FILE="/app/.env";

if [ ! -f "$ENV_FILE" ]; then
  touch "$ENV_FILE"
fi

{
  echo "APP_ENV=${APP_ENV:-production}";
  echo "APP_KEY=${APP_KEY:-base64:OQ8H9vjocvQh284ojDBrODQ2HkrgWGDvdLCaQniHz0M=}";
  echo "APP_DEBUG=${APP_DEBUG:-false}";
  echo "APP_URL=${APP_URL:-https://laravel-demo.dev}";

  echo "DB_CONNECTION=${DB_CONNECTION:-mysql}";
  echo "DB_HOST=${DB_HOST:-database}";
  echo "DB_PORT=${DB_PORT:-3306}";
  echo "DB_DATABASE=${DB_DATABASE:-laravel}";
  echo "DB_USERNAME=${DB_USERNAME:-laravel}";
  echo "DB_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD:-laravel}";

  echo "MAIL_DRIVER=${MAIL_DRIVER:-smtp}";
  echo "MAIL_HOST=${MAIL_HOST:-mailtrap.io}";
  echo "MAIL_PORT=${MAIL_PORT:-2525}";
  echo "MAIL_USERNAME=${MAIL_USERNAME:-null}";
  echo "MAIL_PASSWORD=${MAIL_PASSWORD:-null}";
  echo "MAIL_ENCRYPTION=${MAIL_ENCRYPTION:-null}";

  echo "CACHE_DRIVER=${CACHE_DRIVER:-redis}";
  echo "SESSION_DRIVER=${SESSION_DRIVER:-redis}";
  echo "QUEUE_DRIVER=${QUEUE_DRIVER:-database}";

  echo "REDIS_HOST=${REDIS_HOST:-redis}";
  echo "REDIS_PASSWORD=${REDIS_PASSWORD:-null}";
  echo "REDIS_PORT=${REDIS_PORT:-6379}";

} >> "${ENV_FILE}";

# Allow the web server user to read this file in, and the build user to run `php artisan key:generate`
chown "${CODE_OWNER}":"${APP_GROUP}" "${ENV_FILE}"
chmod 640 "${ENV_FILE}"
```

Included from the `install.sh` file is - 

>**tools/docker/setup/setup-directories.sh**
```bash
#!/bin/sh

set -xe

APP_PATH="/app";

# Create new directories
PUBLIC_DIR="${APP_PATH}/public";
STORAGE_DIR="${APP_PATH}/storage";
FRAMEWORK_DIR="${STORAGE_DIR}/framework";
CACHE_DIR="${FRAMEWORK_DIR}/cache";
VIEWS_DIR="${FRAMEWORK_DIR}/views";
SESSIONS_DIR="${FRAMEWORK_DIR}/sessions";

# Create missing storage directories
mkdir -p "${PUBLIC_DIR}";
mkdir -p "${STORAGE_DIR}";
mkdir -p "${FRAMEWORK_DIR}";
mkdir -p "${CACHE_DIR}";
mkdir -p "${VIEWS_DIR}";
mkdir -p "${SESSIONS_DIR}";
```

Lets now create our custom environment variables file - 

>**tools/docker/usr/local/share/env/20-project**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

export WORK_DIRECTORY=${WORK_DIRECTORY:-/app}
export WEB_DIRECTORY=${WEB_DIRECTORY:-${WORK_DIRECTORY}/public}
export STORAGE_DIR=${STORAGE_DIR:-${WORK_DIRECTORY}/storage}
export UPLOADS_DIR=${UPLOADS_DIR:-${STORAGE_DIR}/app/public/uploads}
export FRAMEWORK_DIR=${FRAMEWORK_DIR:-${STORAGE_DIR}/framework}
export CACHE_DIR=${CACHE_DIR:-${FRAMEWORK_DIR}/cache}
export VIEWS_DIR=${VIEWS_DIR:-${FRAMEWORK_DIR}/views}
export SESSIONS_DIR=${CACHE_DIR:-${SESSIONS_DIR}/sessions}

export APP_ENV=${APP_ENV:-production}
export APP_KEY=${APP_KEY:-base64:OQ8H9vjocvQh284ojDBrODQ2HkrgWGDvdLCaQniHz0M=}
export APP_DEBUG=${APP_DEBUG:-false}
export APP_URL=${APP_URL:-https://laravel-demo.dev}

export DB_CONNECTION=${DB_CONNECTION:-mysql}
export DB_HOST=${DB_HOST:-database}
export DB_PORT=${DB_PORT:-3306}
export DB_DATABASE=${DB_DATABASE:-laravel}
export DB_USERNAME=${DB_USERNAME:-laravel}
export DB_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD:-laravel}

export MAIL_DRIVER=${MAIL_DRIVER:-smtp}
export MAIL_HOST=${MAIL_HOST:-mailtrap.io}
export MAIL_PORT=${MAIL_PORT:-2525}
export MAIL_USERNAME=${MAIL_USERNAME:-null}
export MAIL_PASSWORD=${MAIL_PASSWORD:-null}
export MAIL_ENCRYPTION=${MAIL_ENCRYPTION:-null}

export CACHE_DRIVER=${CACHE_DRIVER:-redis}
export SESSION_DRIVER=${SESSION_DRIVER:-redis}
export QUEUE_DRIVER=${QUEUE_DRIVER:-database}

export REDIS_HOST=${REDIS_HOST:-redis}
export REDIS_PASSWORD=${REDIS_PASSWORD:-null}
export REDIS_PORT=${REDIS_HOST_PORT:-6379}
```

For the majority of this file we are setting environment variables using the default Laravel variables found in the `.env` file, with a few extras and one exception. The `REDIS_PORT` being set is looking for an injected variable `REDIS_HOST_PORT`. This is to mitigate the issue where `SERVICENAME_PORT` is a reserved keyword in `docker-compose` which ultimately sets the `redis` connection to `tcp://ip.ad.dr.ress:port`

For more information on how the custom environment variables are loaded please refer to the main base image [readme](https://github.com/continuouspipe/dockerfiles/tree/master/ubuntu/16.04#default-environment-variables)


The only thing left to do for our Docker configuration is to setup our `docker-compose.yml` file.

> **docker-compose.yml**
```yaml
version: "2"
services:
    web:
        build:
            context: .
            args:
                - APP_ENV
        links:
            - database
            - redis
        expose:
            - 80
            - 443
        ports:
            - "80:80"
            - "443:443"
        volumes:
            - .:/app
        environment:
          APP_USER_LOCAL: "true"

    database:
        image: quay.io/continuouspipe/mysql5.7:stable
        environment:
            MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: laravel
            MYSQL_DATABASE: laravel
            MYSQL_USER: laravel
            MYSQL_PASSWORD: laravel
        expose:
            - 3306
        ports:
            - "3360:3360"

    redis:
        image: quay.io/continuouspipe/redis3:stable
        expose:
            - 6379
        ports:
            - "6379:6379"
```

Here we have three services, `web`, `database` and `redis`. Our `web` service is our main service that builds from our Dockerfile previously mentioned. This will link to our `database` and `redis` services which use `quay.io/continuouspipe/mysql5.7:stable` and `quay.io/continuouspipe/redis3:stable` respectivly. These are just standard `redis:3.0` and `mysql:5.7` official images in a simple wrapper that allows a faster patching mechanism.

We are injecting `APP_ENV` into our web container as a build argument. This will allow `composer install` to run on `docker-compose up`. Essentially, this means a developer can simply clone the project repo and start the Docker container and all the setup is handled for them. No more manual steps should be required.

Additionally our web container is exposing both port `80` and `443`, this is because our base [php7-nginx](https://github.com/continuouspipe/dockerfiles/tree/master/php-nginx) image is creating a self signed SSL certificate and forcing our app to use `https://` as default.

There is an additional environment variable being set for our `web` container, `APP_USER_LOCAL`, which is used to fix volume permission issues.


{{< warning title="Warning" >}}
`APP_USER_LOCAL` should only be used in development as using this could cause a security risk. Please see [Volume Permission Fixes](https://github.com/continuouspipe/dockerfiles/tree/master/ubuntu/16.04#volume-permission-fixes) for more information 
{{< /warning >}}


Docker needs to be able to execute the files we have in `tools/docker/setup`. Lets make sure that all files have execute permissions - 

```shell
$ chmod -R +x tools/docker/setup
```

We can now start our Docker containers - 

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```

If everything has gone to plan, we should now see the famous "Laravel" splash page at `https://localhost`

![Laravel Splash](/images/guides/laravel/laravel-splash.png)

### Prepare to build on ContinuousPipe

We configure ContinuousPipe with a `continuous-pipe.yml` file in the root of our project. This is the main configuration file that defines each of our tasks to be executed. As this configuration file is YAML, please ensure proper indentation is set, otherwise ContinuousPipe will fail to load the configuration file correctly.

First thing we define is some environment variables - 

>**continuous-pipe.yaml (partial)**
```yaml
environment_variables:
    - name: APP_ENV
      value: "production"
    - name: REMOTE_ENV
      value: "1"
```

We are simply setting a the `APP_ENV` for use within our build and `REMOTE_ENV` which can be used to distinguish the difference between a local docker build and a ContinuousPipe build. This can be useful when you need to to pull additional assets from 3rd party services or perhaps build the frontend assets in your deployments. For this tutorial, we are using this to allow us to generate a new `APP_KEY` during the deployment stage.

Next we define our tasks, our first task is building our image - 

>**continuous-pipe.yaml (partial)**
```yaml
tasks:
    images:
        build:
            environment:
                - name: APP_ENV
                  value: ${APP_ENV}

            services:
                web:
                    image: quay.io/continuouspipe/laravel-demo
```

Here we injecting the `APP_ENV` build argument, the same as we did for our `docker-compose.yml` file. We also define the registry repository address where we want to push our freshly built images to.

The next task to run is the `infrastructure` task - 

>**continuous-pipe.yaml (partial)**
```yaml
infrastructure:
   deploy:
       cluster: ${CLUSTER}
       environment:
           name: '"project-key-" ~ code_reference.branch'

       services:
           database:
               specification:
                   volumes:
                       - type: persistent
                         name: database-volume
                         capacity: 5Gi
                         storage_class: default

                   volume_mounts:
                       - name: database-volume
                         mount_path: /var/lib/mysql

                   command:
                       - /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh
                       - mysqld
                       - --ignore-db-dir=lost+found
                       - --max_allowed_packet=128M

                   ports:
                       - 3306

                   resources:
                       requests:
                           cpu: 50m
                           memory: 250Mi
                       limits:
                           cpu: 500m
                           memory: 500Mi

           redis:
               deployment_strategy:
                   readiness_probe:
                       type: tcp
                       port: 6379

               specification:
                   ports:
                       - 6379

                   resources:
                       requests:
                           cpu: 50m
                           memory: 100Mi
                       limits:
                           cpu: 250m
                           memory: 250Mi
```

This is where we build our redis and database containers. We define a persistent volume to store our database so we don't need to build again on subsequent deployments. We are also setting the required cluster resources for these containers. Notice we set `cluster: ${CLUSTER}`. This is pulling the cluster name we previously set in the ContinuousPipe UI under Clusters.

{{< note title="Note" >}}
An important change for each of our tasks is to define the project key. Where I have set an environment name as `"project-key-" ~ code_reference.branch`, you should replace the `project-key` with your project name you defined earlier in the ContinuousPipe setup step.
{{< /note >}}

Our next task in the list is `initialization` - 

>**continuous-pipe.yaml (partial)**
```yaml
initialization:
    run:
        cluster: ${CLUSTER}
        environment:
            name: '"project-key-" ~ code_reference.branch'

        image:
            from_service: web

        commands:
            - tools/docker/setup/setup.sh

        environment_variables: &WEB_ENV_VARS
            - name: APP_ENV
              value: ${APP_ENV}
            - name: REMOTE_ENV
              value: ${REMOTE_ENV}
            - name: APP_URL
              value: ${APP_URL}
            - name: APP_USER_LOCAL
              value: false

    filter:
        expression: 'tasks.infrastructure.services.database.created'
```

The purpose of this task is to allow us to run any database specific tasks for our application. This might be the combination of a `php artisan migrate` and `php artisan db:seed`. Notice we are using the `filter` `expression: 'tasks.infrastructure.services.database.created'`, this ensures we only run this when we know the database is finished building. We run these commands by executing a script `tools/docker/setup/setup.sh` inside the container that has had some specific environment variables set.

**Note: We have explicitly set `APP_USER_LOCAL` to `false` to elevate any security concerns previously mentioned with this setting**

The last task in this configuration is `application` - 

>**continuous-pipe.yaml (partial)**
```yaml
application:
   deploy:
       cluster: ${CLUSTER}
       environment:
           name: '"project-key-" ~ code_reference.branch'

       services:
           web:
               specification:
                   accessibility:
                       from_external: true

                   environment_variables:
                       <<: *WEB_ENV_VARS

                   resources:
                       requests:
                           cpu: 50m
                           memory: 500Mi

                       limits:
                           cpu: 1
                           memory: 2G

                   ports:
                       - 80
                       - 443

               deployment_strategy:
                   readiness_probe:
                       type: tcp
                       port: 80
                       initial_delay_seconds: 30
                       period_seconds: 30
                       failure_threshold: 120
```

Here we are creating a new web container, making it accessible to the public which instructs ContinuousPipe to get an IP address from the load balancer. We inject the environment variables previously defined in the `initalization` task, and finally we configure the resources required from the cluster and open up the required ports, `80` and `443`

The last section of this task is the `deployment_strategy` which configures how ContinuousPipe will determine when the container is finished building and if it was successful or not. For more information on health checks please refer to [http://docs.continuouspipe.io/](http://docs.continuouspipe.io/configuration/deployments/#health-checks)

Now that we have defined our `continuous-pipe.yml` file lets configure that one last script we set to use in the `initialization` task. Create a new file `tools/docker/setup/setup.sh` with the following - 

>**tools/docker/setup/setup.sh**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -xe

# Bring in the as_code_owner function, to run commands as the user who owns the code.
# Usually the "build" user.
source /usr/local/share/bootstrap/setup.sh
source /usr/local/share/bootstrap/common_functions.sh

WORK_DIRECTORY="/app";

export DB_CONNECTION=${DB_CONNECTION:-mysql}
export DB_HOST=${DB_HOST:-database}
export DB_PORT=${DB_PORT:-3306}
export DB_DATABASE=${DB_DATABASE:-laravel}
export DB_USERNAME=${DB_USERNAME:-laravel}
export DB_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD:-laravel}
export DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD:-laravel}

cd "${WORK_DIRECTORY}" || exit 1;
as_code_owner "php artisan migrate"
```

We are simply running a `php artisan migrate` here to setup all our defined database tables.

OK, we are finally ready to push all our code to GitHub and utilise ContinuousPipe to build and deploy our application on the cluster.

Lets now push our code to GitHub to trigger ContinuousPipe - 

```shell
$ git init
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Initial Commit"
$ git remote add origin https://github.com:continuouspipe/demo-laravel.git
$ git push -u origin master

```
Thats it, we should now see ContinuousPipe working through our defined tasks - 

![Dashboard](/images/guides/laravel/flow-overview.png)

Once all our tasks have finished we should see a success status, everything green and a public endpoint for the web service.

![Complete Tasks](/images/guides/laravel/tide-complete-tasks.png)

If we now visit this endpoint in the browser e.g. `https://104.199.75.150/` we should now see that Laravel splash page we previously seen when running in our local Docker build -

## Remote development environment

Since our project is essentially just running in docker and it now works on both local Docker and ContinuousPipe we can effectively turn our cluster performance into a really fast development environment.

We are going to instruct ContinuousPipe to build us a new environment by creating our own "dev" branch in our GitHub repository. When complete, we will watch our local file system for any changes to our codebase and synchronise these changes into our running `web` container. It's really that simple.

### Install `cp-remote`

`cp-remote` is available on OSX, Linux and Windows. Please refer to the [remote development installation instructions]({{< relref "remote-development/getting-started.md#installation" >}}) for each of the platforms.

For simplicity, here is the OSX installation instructions

```shell
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/continuouspipe/remote-environment-client/gh-pages/0.0.1/darwin-amd64.gz > cp-remote.gz
gzip -d cp-remote.gz;
mv cp-remote /usr/local/bin/cp-remote
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cp-remote
```

{{< note title="Note" >}}
`rsync` & `git` are required for `cp-remote` to work
{{< /note >}}


### Setup

Now that we have `cp-remote` installed, we are ready to setup our remote environment. From the root of your project run the following - 

```shell
$ cp-remote setup
```

You will now be asked a series of questions that relate to how you have configured ContinuousPipe and your cluster details. Please refer to the [remote development setup instructions]({{< relref "remote-development/command-setup.md" >}}) for more information.

### Build the environment

Run the following - 

```shell
$ cp-remote build
```
This is now going to create a new git branch from the current branch with the name you defined in the setup. Its going to push this branch to GitHub which will then trigger ContinuousPipe to create you a new developer environment. You should now see the something like - 

```shell
Pushing to remote
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To github.com:continuouspipe/demo-laravel.git
 * [new branch]      master -> dev-richdynamix
Continuous Pipe will now build your developer environment
You can see when it is complete and find its IP address at https://ui.continuouspipe.io/
Please wait until the build is complete to use any of this tool's other commands.
```

![Dashboard with dev environment](/images/guides/laravel/dashboard-with-dev.png)

You can check that the environment is ready either from the ContinuousPipe UI or by running the following - 

```shell
$ cp-remote ck
```

Which should display something like this  - 

```shell
checking connection for environment laravel-demo-dev-richdynamix
Connected successfully and found 3 pods for the environment
```

Now that we know all three containers (pods) have been setup we need to obtain the IP address from the ContinuousPipe UI for that tide. Lets visit the IP address in our browser and once again, we will see the Laravel splash page.

![Laravel Splash](/images/guides/laravel/laravel-splash.png)

### Watching for changes

From within your project root, lets start watching for file changes - 

```shell
$ cp-remote watch
Watching for changes. Quit anytime with Ctrl-C.

.cp-remote-ignore was missing or empty and has been created with the default ignore settings.

Destination Pod: web-3232721034-k6g9t
```
Here we run the `cp-remote watch` command which will use our default `web` container as the destination pod.

Lets edit some code and see our changes reflected in the browser. Open `resources/views/welcome.blade.php` and change the title on `Line 82`. I will change it to "Awesome Laravel".

![Sublime](/images/guides/laravel/sublime.png)

When you save this file from within your editor, the `cp-remote watch` command will pick up these changes and `RSYNC` them to the web container. Your terminal should look something like the following - 

```shell
$ cp-remote watch
Watching for changes. Quit anytime with Ctrl-C.

.cp-remote-ignore was missing or empty and has been created with the default ignore settings.

Destination Pod: web-3232721034-k6g9t
Synchronizing filesystem changes...
resources/views/welcome.blade.php
Done.
```

Now when you check the site in the browser you should see the following - 

![Awesome Laravel](/images/guides/laravel/awesome-laravel.png)

Here is a quick screencast of that syncing in action - 

[![Laravel Screencast](/images/guides/laravel/awesome-laravel-screencast.gif)](/images/guides/laravel/awesome-laravel-screencast.gif)


The syncing speeds are pretty fast, so fast in fact, I can run this from a train wifi while retaining the performance of the cloud hosting.

For full instructions on other commands in the `cp-remote` CLI tool, such as port forwarding, connecting to the web container via BASH or even destroying the environment visit the [README](https://github.com/continuouspipe/remote-environment-client)

## Conclusion

ContinuousPipe is a fantastic tool for simplifying container orchestration and deployment. Its makes the CI/CD workflow much more productive than similar tools available. One of the best and unique features of ContinuousPipe is the remote developer environments. This not only reduces the resource requirements of the developer's laptop, but it also ensures compatibility across platforms. 

There is far more we can do with ContinuousPipe to increase productivity, for example, we can use filters to determine when tasks are run. Perhaps we only want certain branches to build environments, or a certain GitHub label on a Pull-Request to trigger the build. We can also go one step further and separate our builds into pipelines. Perhaps we want to have a separate pipeline for production compared to development or testing. This is useful if there are certain environment variables and tasks that should only be used in development but not production.

This getting started guide should be treated as a first step, please refer to the [http://docs.continuouspipe.io](http://docs.continuouspipe.io) for more advanced tutorials.
