Any web development project starts with a team. A team contains some cluster and Docker Registry credentials, as well as some _flows_. A _flow_ is basically a connected code repository with [some configuration]({{< relref "configuration-files.md" >}}) (as little as possible).

At this moment, you should be able to organise the [tasks]({{< relref "tasks.md" >}}) you want and therefore [build your Docker images]({{< relref "images.md" >}}), [deploy the services]({{< relref "deployments.md" >}}), and run your [migration and/or tests]({{< relref "commands.md" >}}).
