The remote development feature of ContinuousPipe allows a developer to work locally while viewing and testing changes in a remote environment. A command line tool `cp-remote` keeps local and remote files in sync.

To get started, you will need to [install the remote development client]({{< relref "remote-development/getting-started.md#installation" >}}).
