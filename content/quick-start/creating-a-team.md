When you log in for the first time you will see the Team overview screen, which will be empty. You'll be prompted to create a new Team.

To create a Team, just click the "CREATE A TEAM" button in the top right of the interface.

You will then be asked to enter the following:

* **Name** - A name for your Team
* **Unique Identifier** - An identifier for your Team, which needs to not be in use by anyone else. 

The Team will not be created until a unique identifier is found. You will be told if the identifier is already in use when you click "CREATE". 

The new Team will now be visible in the Team overview screen.
