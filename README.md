# Getting Started

This documentation is generated with Hugo.

`brew install hugo` to install Hugo.

You'll also need a working Python installation - run `brew install python`.

Finally, to render the code blocks, we use Pygments - run `pip install Pygments`.

When everything's installed, run `hugo server --theme=hugo-material-docs --buildDrafts` to start the server. Point your browser at [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/).
